## Your Task
* Find a problem worth solving, analyzing, or visualizing. Use ML in the context of technologies learned.
Your task is to tell a story through data visualizations. Focus on providing users an interactive means to explore data themselves. 

* You must use: Scikit-Learn and/or another machine learning library. You must use at least two of the following: 
Python Pandas, Python Matplotlib, HTML/CSS/Bootstrap, JavaScript Plotly, JavaScript D3.js, JavaScript Leaflet, 
SQL Database, MongoDB Database, Google Cloud SQL, Amazon AWS, Tableau

* Host application using Heroku or a tool of your choice.

Prepare a 10-minute presentation that lays out your theme, coding approach, data munging techniques, and final visualization

## Your Task
* Find a problem worth solving, analyzing, or visualizing. Use ML in the context of technologies learned.
Your task is to tell a story through data visualizations. Focus on providing users an interactive means to explore data themselves. 

* You must use: Scikit-Learn and/or another machine learning library. You must use at least two of the following: 
Python Pandas, Python Matplotlib, HTML/CSS/Bootstrap, JavaScript Plotly, JavaScript D3.js, JavaScript Leaflet, 
SQL Database, MongoDB Database, Google Cloud SQL, Amazon AWS, Tableau

* Host application using Heroku or a tool of your choice.

Prepare a 10-minute presentation that lays out your theme, coding approach, data munging techniques, and final visualization

* Conclusions
	* as accurate as stock predictors may be, they will not alleviate the very human emotions of wanting to buy and sell inherent in owning stocks.
		* Timeframe
		* position size
		* price volatility and risk
		* too much of overall portfolio allocated to one stock or sector
		* Random nature of stock market
		* unexpected events such as pandemic, govt policy and new well funded competitors
